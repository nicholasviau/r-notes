# summarise()

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## dplyr 1.0.0 Changes

* See the [article](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/03/dplyr-1-0-0-summarise/).
* Improved control of grouping.

## Grouping Changes

Let's load the `starwars` dataset and check out what we're talking about.

```{r}
head(starwars)
```


```{r}
starwars %>% 
  group_by(homeworld, species) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())
```


You can alwasy override the message with `options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)`. 

Also keep in mind that `.groups` is an experimental phase of development, meaning it may change in the future.
