# About {-}

My name is Nick and this is a collection of R notes I have compiled over the years. Though much of what is found in here can be found elsewhere, the format here suits my needs, and is somewhere between a longform blog post, a cookbook, and a technical manual. Frankly I don't know if this will ever mature into anything, but I hope you find it useful if you happen to stumble upon it.
