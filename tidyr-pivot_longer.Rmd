## Pivot Longer

[`pivot_longer()` Offical Documentation](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html)

We use `pivot_longer()` when we want to go from a "wide" to a "longer" dataset. In more formal words, we use this function where we have columns that should not be columns and instead be different levels of a factor variable. This is common if much of your exposure to datawork has been in spreadsheets. Sometimes this is obvious, sometimes not.

```{r}
head(relig_income)
```

```{r}
relig_income %>%
  pivot_longer(-religion, names_to = "income", values_to = "count") %>%
  head()
```
