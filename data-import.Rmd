# Data Import

## Reading in Multiple Files

You may want to read in multiple files at the same time. For example, you have dozens of `.csv` files with a common structure that you wish to import and combine as a single data frame, or perhaps they are of varying sizes and wish to save them as a list of dataframes. 

### Common Structure

```{r}
combined <- map_dfr(files, read_csv)
```

Sometimes I prefer to save the the file location of the original `.csv` file. To do this, you must construct an **anonymous function** with further arguments.

```{r}
combined <- map_dfr(files, ~{
  read_csv(.x) %>%
    mutate(file = .x)
})
```

### Different Structure

Use 

```{r}
paste(rep("c", 20), collapse = "")
```
