We use `pivot_wider()` when we want to go from a "wide" to a "longer" dataset. In more formal words, we use this function where we have columns that should not be columns and instead be different levels of a factor variable. This is common if much of your exposure to datawork has been in spreadsheets. Sometimes this is obvious, sometimes not.
