# Scoped Verbs

The scoped verbs need three things to work:

1. Data
2. A **predicate function** (i.e., a function that returns `TRUE` OR `FALSE`) that selects the columns we wish to work with.
3. 

The following functions follow the `verb_*()` syntax, where `verb` is the function and `*` represents the scope.

## `filter_*()`

## Renaming

```{r}
iris %>% rename_all(toupper)
```
